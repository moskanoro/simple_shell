.SH DESCRIPTION
The hsh (Simple Shell) is a program that takes user commands from the keyboard and sends them to the operating system for execution. It offers various features and can execute a wide range of commands. When in interactive mode, the shell typically provides a prompt before each command, processes the given arguments, executes the command, and handles any potential errors. The hsh reads input as lines from a file and tokenizes it into words based on whitespaces.
